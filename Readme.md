### Q-1 What does the Shared Responsibility model mean in Cloud Security? 
### How does it change as per the cloud service provider and various service
### offerings (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)? (Try to take practical examples such as AWS EC2, Azure 
### virtual machine and try to explain the shift as we move to AWS  Lambda, or Azure Paas services).


  ```sh
   The Cloud Security can be divided into two parts:
   
   
   1) Security of Cloud (Cloud Provider's Responsibility) 
   The responsibility of Cloud Providers includes the physical security of data-centres, 
   and the infrastructure inside (CPU, Storage, Network). 
   
   2) Security in Cloud (Our Responsibility)
   Our responsibility will be determined by the Cloud Services we select(IaaS,PaaS.SaaS)
   
   (i) IaaS -Taking example of a EC2 Instance, We are responsible for:
   
   a) OS Security(Timely updating the Patches and hardening of the machine.)
   b) Security of any Application on the the VM.
   c) Security of the network(Security Group, VPC, Authentication).
   d) Security of the data(volume) used by EC2.

   (ii) PaaS  - AWS Lambda : We are responsible for:
   a) Application Security - AWS Identity and Access Management,
                             Security of traditional application-level attacks like SQL injection etc.
                             Security of any dependencies use in the lambda function
   
   b) Data Security -  Ensure Clean /tmp folder.
                       Ensuring unencrypted environment variables are stored in Secret manager.
                       Logging should be secure and it should not log out sensitive data.


```

### Q-2 Now as you have identified how security shifts with different service offerings. 
### Therefore, in this activity, you would consider a virtual machine service, 
### any 1 (EC2, Azure virtual machines, or GCP compute engine) and answer the following:
### • How can you ensure network security for the chosen virtual machine service?
### • How can you ensure identity and access management for the same?
### • Finally, how can you ensure logging and monitoring is enabled for the same?

```sh
    A)  To make sure the network is secure for a EC2 these are the   
        Ensure that we are not using Default VPC.
        Configure Security group with Proper inbound and outbound Rules. 
        Services like WAF should be used to make the machine secure.
        Internet gateway should be properly configured .       
        NACL should be configured to filter the requests for each subnet.
        
    B) For better identity and access management Instead of using the security 
       credentials, we can create users and add them to the group based the requirment and 
       give everyone appropriate elevation based on the requirement .
       IAM also allows us to create roles with aws managed policies and custom policies
       ans we can assign those roles ec2 to let it talk to other aws services.
       
    C) Too ensure logging and monitoring, we need install the cloud watch logging agent on the the ec2 machine.
       After the installation is complete we need to start the loggin agent on the machine(using the systemctl command).
       We need a make sure an IAM role is attached to access CloudWatch from EC2 
       (If we had already have an IAM role with CloudWatchFullAcces) else we need to create a custom policy with
       CloudWatchFullAcces and attached with a role and assign it to the EC2 machine.
            
       
       
```

### Q-3 Now you have explored IaaS service, so what cloud configuration acts as an activator for SSRF attack. 
### List down the activator (mis-configuration) in all of the following:
###    1. AWS EC2.
###    2. Azure virtual machines.
###    3. Google Compute engine.

```shell

   The Activator mis-configuration in the following:
       1. AWS EC2                   - Using  IMDSv1 
       2. Azure virtual machines.   - allowing all the processes on the VM to access IMDS endpoint.
       3. Google Compute engine.    - using legacy Compute Engine instance metadata APIs  
```

### Q-4 In software development lifecycle, some solutions require the use of secrets such as connecting 
### to the cloud database or protecting the data stored storage services. Therefore, 
### list down different types of secrets and the purpose they serve. Finally, what cloud services are used for 
### the secure storage of secrets?. (You can take any cloud provider into consideration).

```shell
   Secrets: are any sequence of bytes under 10 KB like connection strings, account keys, or the passwords for private key files.
   Keys: involve cryptographic keys used to encrypt data or decrypt the data.
   Certificates- Certificates is simply a managed X.509 certificate. 
   
   
   Services on AWS that can be used to manage secret are AWS Secret manager and AWS kms they both work
   in conjuction with each other.
